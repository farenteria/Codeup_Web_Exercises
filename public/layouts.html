				<p>Although details, such as the superlaser's location, shifted between different concept models during production of Star Wars, the notion of the Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them.[1] The Death Star was created by the dean of special effects, John Stears.[2][3] The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials.[4] Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light &amp; Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi.[5] Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film.[5] Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.</p>
				<p>In 2012, a proposal on the White House's web site urging the United States government to build a real Death Star as an economic stimulus and job creation measure gained more than 25,000 signatures, enough to qualify for an official response. The official (tongue-in-cheek) response was released in January 2013[28] and noted that the cost of building a real Death Star has been estimated at $850 quadrillion, while the International Business Times cited a Centives economics blog calculation that at current rates of steel production, the Death Star would not be ready for more than 833,000 years.[29] The White House response also stated "the Administration does not support blowing up planets" and questions about funding a weapon "with a fundamental flaw that can be exploited by a one-man starship" as reasons for denying the petition.</p>
