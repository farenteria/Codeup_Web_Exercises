				<h2><a name="artemis">Artemis</a></h2>
				<p>April 16, 2015</p>
				<p>Daughter of Zeus and Leta, the Greek Goddess of the Hunt is a highly-regarded adc in the Smite world. She excels in single target damage, with a passive that gives her a higher chance in cricital damage. However, her kit only allows her to be played in an adc role with her clear being abysmal. The huntress has two moves for crowd control, with the other two meant for damage. She relies on her basic attacks for that damage, and must be played accordingly. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Early Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Her third ability, Suppress the Insolent, is key in leveling up first. It fires a volley of arrows in an AoE circle that both damage and slow enemy gods. This is her only clear ability, and it won't do much damage.</li> 
							<li>That being said, it's great for harassing the enemy in the early game. Position your Suppress the Insolent in such a way that hits both the minion wave and the enemy gods. This will allow you some extra time for the first few minutes without the enemy becoming too aggressive.</li>
							<li>For the first ten minutes of the game, you should keep to your lane defensively. Artemis is a late game powerhouse, but she must survive the early game. Don't worry about the mid lane, and don't push too hard. You just need to stay alive.</li>
							<li>If you are behind, stay back. Don't worry about losing your tower. Just focus on getting to the late game</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Mid Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You should still focus on staying in your lane and not dying.</li>
							<li>Keep the gold fury warded, and keep an offensive ward between the enemy's two towers. Do not attack the gold fury unless the enemy doesn't have a Wrath of the Gods in the vicinity. If the enemy invades while you're attacking the gold fury, keep attacking the gold fury. The mid laner and jungler should keep the enemy away. Don't shift your attention.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Late Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You will be big by this point. You will do a ton of damage, and your ultimate gives you enough time to kill someone with three to four basic attakcs.</li>
							<li>Artemis will have little-to-no defense. Stay in the back, and never initiate. Follow your team, because the enemy knows how strong you are by now.</li>
							<li>During team fights, focus on mages first, as they are the weakest. The adc should follow, but their attention should not be to you. Make sure that the enemy adc is distracted before you start in on him/her. Warriors and guardians should be last, because they will take a while.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<!-- Athena -->
			<article>
				<h2><a name="athena">Athena</a></h2>
				<p>April 16, 2015</p>
				<p>The Greek Goddess of Wisdom is the strongest support in the game. She has been the best support for over a year. Her kit remains unchanged, and as long she's played wisely you will win every encounter you have with this guardian.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Early Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Upgrade Shield Wall first. Unless you need to escape, there's no reason to upgrade any other abilty over Shield Wall.</li>
							<li>You will need to get several blue potions, because Athena is mana hungry. She relies on her Confound and Shield Wall combo which is draining in the early game. </li>
							<li>Still, don't be afraid to use that combo every time you can. It will provide a lot of damage, if your adc can coordinate with you. If done properly, you can get early kills and get an early lead.</li>
							<li>You'll probably be able to take the mid harpies easily, and with no contention.</li>
							<li>Use your ultimate to help any other member of your team. You'll be fine. Just do it.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Mid Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You should have a few defensive items by now, and you'll constantly start fights. Use your combo when attacking, and communicate with your team so they know when to attack.</li>
							<li>You'll want to start the Gold Fury whenever possible as bait. If the team doesn't try to defend, then go ahead and finish the Gold Fury. If the enemy team arrives, then use your combo to drag the enemy to your clutches, and have your allies crush them. </li>
						</ul>
					<li>Late Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This will be the same as the mid game, but you'll have much more defense, and you'll have to defend the Fire Giant as well.</li>
							<li>Don't attack fire giant, unless most of the enemy is dead. It's extremely difficult and unecessary to try and sneak the giant form under the enemey's nose.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<!-- Hel -->
			<article>
				<h2><a name="hel">Hel</a></h2>
				<p>April 16, 2015</p>
				<p>The duaghter of the trickster god Loki, the Norse Goddess lays judgment on the dead. She's unique in Smite, being one of two gods that has seven abilities in her repertoire (the other being Ullr). She accomplishes this by being in two stances, light and dark. He light stance gives her healing moves while her dark stance is meant for damage. It takes time to learn how to control such a diety, but it is time well spent as she can dominate the solo lane in the mid game.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Early Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Always level up her Repulse/Inspire ability first. In light stance it heals you and allies near you, while in dark stance it deals heavy damage to enemies near you.</li>
							<li>Hel is a very squishy goddess. Her main damage dealer, Repulse, will not do much until the late game. Even worse, in order to use it properly you have to put yourself in danger. You will be pushed under your tower due to this, and maybe even lose the first tower. Don't fret. Just keep yourself alive, and buy items.	</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Mid Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>By this point, you're going to be doing a medium amount of damage. As long as you're warded, don't be afraid to push up a bit.</li>
							<li>You'll still be very squishy, and it won't help that you're enemies will only be getting stronger. Never put yourself in the front-line except for a quick Repulse.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Late Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You will be a strong diety. It's horrifying how much damage you dole out at this point.</li>
							<li>Again, you'll die easily. During team fights, stay in the back. Do some damage, then scurry back behind your tankier characters.</li>
							<li>Your cleanse is essential during team fights. Make sure to learn when your enemy plans to use CC on your team so you can prepare yourself. This might seem hard, but it's not by the late game.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<!-- Nemesis -->
			<article>
				<h2><a name="nemesis">Nemesis</a></h2>
				<p>April 20, 2015</p>
				<p>The Goddess of Vengeance holds no more mercy against those whom divine retribution sets its steel on. An excellent assassin who was one of the most OP characters upon release, her kit allows you to slow a target and wear him/her down as quickly as possible. Nemesis' kit includes a dash, slow, and shield that is incredibly deadly under the right hands.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Early Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Unless invaded, you'll want to upgrade her Swift Vengeance first. It deals damage in an AoE cone, and slows enemies down. You'll be doing a great amount of poke damage in the solo lane.</li>
							<li>Leave early, and gank the mid lane. Keep up your communicatins with your solo laner so you know where the enemy jungler is. </li>
						</ul>
					<li>Mid Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Shut down your adc, solo,  and mid laner, as they will be trouble. Don't worry as much of the enemy support and jungler, but kill them if a chance arises. You can never have too many kills.</li>
							<li>Your support should be taking care of the gold fury side. That leaves you to use your HoG on your jungle objectives. Communicate with the support to make sure that at least one of you has HoG available for the gold fury.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Late Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You will have several team fights. You will no initiate. Wait for someone to stun a god, or for your support to jump in.</li>
							<li>Only initite when you're not going into a team fight.</li>
							<li>You are great at taking down low-level targets, or those that are escaping. Use that to your advantage when contesting the fire giant.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			</article>

			<!-- Scylla -->
			<article>
				<h2><a name="scylla">Scylla</a></h2>
				<p>April 16, 2015</p>
				<p>The Horror of the Sea, Scylla's looks are deceiving. She's nothing short of a monster waiting to destroy anyone in her path. Her kit is excellent, because she has a root, an escape, and two damaging abilities. She requires extra precision, but she'll reward the most accurate of players.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Early Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Scylla is very weak for the first ten minutes of the game. Stay back, and use your Crush to get as many minions as you can</li>
							<li>You will lose several minions to your tower, but don't get crazy and try to get too aggressive. Just like Artemis, you're power comes in the late game.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Mid Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You will have some power now. Use your Sic 'Em to stun someone, and your Crush to weaken them considerably. You might not kill them, but most likely that enemy god will have to return to base to heal up.</li>
							<li>Learn how to time your ultimate. Every kill you get with I'm a Monster grants you more time in that state.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Late Game</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If you have made it to this point without dying too frequently, you're finished. You're abilities alone will be enough in team fights to make sure you win every time.</li>
							<li>You are still squishy, so stay in the backline throwing Sic 'Em and Crushes. Impossible to lose that way.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
